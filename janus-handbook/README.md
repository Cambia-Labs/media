# The Janus Handbook

## Janus Overview
The Janus platform is modular and scalable microservices environment that is coupled with an engineering methodology for building applications and services rapidly, at scale and with a high level of quality. It is the technical ecosystem that supports integrated applications for Cambia Consumer Solutions and other business entities with a Consumer focus. The Janus platform employs infrastructure as code to programmatically provision infrastructural resources and deploy containerized stacks. These containers are immutable, ensuring that stacks deployed in dev run identically to those in test and prod. The Janus platform embraces the concept of inner source, and we highly encourage developer contributions to and extension of the platform. 

Four high-level objectives we always keep in mind:

* Allow developers to focus on productivity and quality in delivery
* Remove futzing with infrastructure, provisioning and environment
* Make the path of least resistance for developers also the righteous path to security, quality, scalability and maintainability
* Automate, automate, automate!

## Culture Code
The Janus platform team is deliberate about our cultureand builds software that enables developers to fulfill Cambia's mission: 

> To be a catalyst to transform health care, 
creating a person-focused and economically
 sustainable system.


To do that, we have adopted a culture that enables us to hire the best talent, help people unlock their potential, and push toward the vision together.

**Sidebar:** What's culture? It is a set of shared beliefs, values, and practices. Culture happens, planned or not. It behooves us to plan for a culture that we love.

This document is part manifesto, part handbook, and part aspiration. While the content may seem natural and obvious to some of us and foreign to others, it is written down so that we can have open conversations about our culture and get better together as a team.   

### **Beliefs**
We believe what we are working on is VERY important. The Janus platform will enable Cambia to innovate faster at lower cost. We are aiming big. We believe what we are building will also be useful outside of Cambia. We believe we can impact healthcare even more by helping entrepreneurs and other healthcare companies do the same thing thing we are doing at Cambia.

 To achieve this extraordinary goal, we need the culture to match. We aspire to be a high-performing and cohesive team, by how much we:

1. Share information openly, broadly and deliberately.
1. Practice [radical candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/our-approach/).
1. Deliver with a relentless focus on our Consumers.

By articulating our objectives and goals, being transparent, measuring progress and outcomes, receiving and giving feedback openly, and focusing on delivering value for our customers, we will be in much better position to succeed. Operating this way may put us at odds with the larger company that is in the midst of transformation. We hope to resolve these conflicts the same way we resolve conflicts internal to the Janus team, by being open with information, being open to feedback and criticism, and aiming to deliver value to the customer.

### **Values**  
With the Cambia values serving as the foundation, we are extending/highlighting the following which we think are critically important:
 
#### **We do what we say we'll Do**
If you ask me to join a meeting or take a look at a document and I say yes, I'll do it. When I communicate a release plan or a project plan, I will deliver on it. Commitments should be entered into thoughtfully. If a blocker arises that affects a project or plan, raise your hand and communicate that as soon as possible. Whether you call it reliability, accountability, or trust, we count on each other to execute and that makes work more enjoyable.    

#### **We drive for Impact**  
We help our developers transform their work with the right tools and expertise. We ask how we can do better, we listen to their feedback, and we find ways to innovate and improve their working lives. Our interest in our developer's success comes through in every interaction and stays with us as we build.

#### **We favor autonomy and take ownership**
We like to be transparent with all things our team works on and how we give and receive feedback. However, transparency is about being open. It is not always about making decision by consensus. We each have a voice and we should voice our opinions, we embrace healthy conflict, so we have the most complete set of information, but not always a vote. We want teammates to develop strong decision-making muscles and put them to use. Designated captains for important decisions, when they are reasonably confident of the right bet for us to take, they decide, and we support the bet as a team.

#### **We don't mind failure** 
We will make mistakes, from time-to-time, and they can ultimately help us get to where we want to go. We embrace the fact that mistakes will happen, adopt a learning attitude when they do occur, and enjoy the challenge of pivoting. We do not hide our mistakes, point fingers, and remain stubborn and insist that we are right. 

#### **We show appreciation** 
We bring a positive, can-do attitude. We celebrate victories. We show our support and gratitude with high fives. We assume positive intent. And we are vulnerable with each other and connect as humans.

#### **We are passionate about our Mission and our Metrics**
There are highs and lows and failures and successes when building something new, nebulous, and big. Often this ebbs and flows every day. We choose to do this, and we believe that what we are doing is important and will have a positive impact on healthcare.

We also focus and are obsessed with our metrics. Our metrics tell us how well we are doing; when it doesn't, we figure out how to improve it so that it does. We like to show people our metrics and use it to tell our stories. Our metrics will help us earn the resources to further our mission.

### **Practice**
#### **Learning**
The Janus Platform team is a learning organization.  We invest in people from on-boarding to continuing education and training. As our greatest asset, teammates are encouraged to take on new challenges and grow. We take time to reflect on our work so that we can continue to improve.

#### **Ownership**
Everyone should exercise leadership through "stepping up" and taking ownership. We should all seek to inspire others, cut through sloth, think creatively, hold high standards and strive for greatness.

To support this, we promote open and direct communication to manage conflict. Passive aggressive behavior or gossip is something we discourage.
If you see something going well, feel free to share it so we can do more of it.  If you see something not going well, please elevate it to your manager so we can fix what's broken. Act like an owner and we'll all get stronger.

#### **Quality** 
We pay attention to software quality as a team. We have a culture where quality is owned by all. We are uncovering better ways of ensuring that we write high-quality software. Through this work we have come to value: 

>business requirements driving development **OVER** development before requirements

>thinking about quality at every step **OVER** thinking about quality only at the end

>testing just enough to allow rapid iteration **OVER** testing every possible case

>whole team ownership of quality **OVER** specialist ownership of quality

>enabling quality with tools and processes **OVER** enforcing quality

**Principles**
* Teams must make quality an integrated part of every step of the software development life cycle.

* To assist in this goal, some developers have particular expertise in and focus on quality.

* These quality-focused developers have three primary responsibilities:

1. Provide documentation and training on quality-related tools and processes.
1. Help teams identify gaps in their design, code, tests, or processes that could affect quality, and help them plan how to fill these gaps.
1. Build infrastructure and tools for running tests, reporting quality metrics, documenting features, monitoring quality in production environments, and performing other quality-related tasks

See [Quality Responsibilities](quality-responsibilities.md) for more information on these principles.

#### **Speed** 
We move fast. We deliver change on a daily basis, which will be reported through dynamic, low friction reporting mechanisms. We give and ask for rapid, actionable feedback, so that we can keep up our momentum.

#### **Goal Setting**
To facilitate alignment, we share goals, objectives and results at the appropriate size and cadence. We have a practice of OKRs. This way we can move fast and stay in sync. 

#### **People over Process**
What we do is dynamic and requires people closely working and communicating with each other, and thus we adopt processes judiciously and thoughtfully. We do not mind revamping the way we do things when they don't work. We strive to act and behave like a Day 1 company. We believe process is most often best defined by the people who will use, adopt, and benefit from the process, rather than by a 3rd party, or by a non-representative group.

#### **Efficiency**
We enjoy being focused and shipping great software that solves real problems. In an effort to retain our focus and avoid time-wasting, we try to avoid doing things that do not result in productivity. The following are some suggestions to help facilitate that.

* Meetings that have to happen should have an agenda, an owner, result in action items with accountable individuals, and take no longer than necessary.  Ad-hoc collaborations is still encouraged. 
* Emails
  * Have a punchline, suggestion, or question upfront with description afterward.  
  * Bullet points and brevity are encouraged. 
  * We use the To: and CC: lines to indicate who we are addressing directly (To: line) and who we are keeping informed (CC: line).
  * We use a descriptive email subject line so people can figure out what type of note it is.
* Face-to-face interactions, or a quick call, is probably the best form of communication - if an email thread has gone on for more than three rounds without resolving the issue, talk to the person directly or get the right people face-to-face or on the phone.

#### **Balance**
We all have a life outside of work. At work, we strive to be efficient and effective, and we're going to work hard. But when we go home, or have a conflict during the day, we have the flexibility to turn-off our working brain and focus on the other aspect of our life. This way, we are really at our best when we are here together.
